This subsystem is one of four systems in a team project designed to make an automatic door open with sensors instead of buttons or handles. This is for safety and convienience for households that have too many things to juggle going in and out of doors. The motor design itself is built to take commands from two IR sensors, a flex sensor, and a rotary encoder.

We also need something within budget and will still work even if the door is slow to open. This motor though small, may be able to use the dimenstions to make the product more userfriendly and compact. </p> <p>H-Bridge</p> <ol> <li> <p>L9110H H-Bridge Motor Driver for DC Motors - 8 DIP - 2.5V-12V 800mA</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$1.50/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Can handle 12V 8 pronged only so only one motor Inexpensive 800 mA current limit Comes with kickback diodes No split logic/power pins </li> <li> <p>Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver for DC or Steppers - 600mA - L293D</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$8.95/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Up to 36 V More expensive 16 pins 600mA current Limit The motor voltage is separate from the logic voltage.

Option 3 is good, but we do not need that many pins and it would complicate the PCB baord and overcrowd the board. </p> <p>Potentiometer</p> <ol> <li> <p>Panel Mount 100K potentiometer (Breadboard Friendly) - 100KB</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$0.95/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Bigger Resistance Havent used before Grippy Shaft Thin prongs Can cause bigger speed changes Only 300 degrees of rotation </li> <li> <p>Panel Mount 10K Log Potentiometer (Breadboard Friendly) - 10K Log</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$0.95/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Grippy Shaft Less resistance High torque Thin Prongs Inexpensive Small handle </li> <li> <p>PTA3043-2010CIB104</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$1.65/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons High resistance Big Size Inexpensive More space taken up on the PCB Slide instead of rotate Not used to this type of potentiometer </li> </ol> <p>Choice: Option 3: PTA3043-2010CIB104</p> <p>Rationale: The slide potentiometer is a lot more user friendly than useal breadboard potentiometers. THis will also help where we can label different resistances to different speeds. Using only a small potentiometer was an option, but the changes in the motor speed would then need to be amplified in an op amp or similar to get results we could get with a higher resistance potentiometer. This also gives a wider range of speeds than a 10k potentiometer. </p> <p>Unregulated Power Supply</p> <ol> <li> <p>Wall Adapter Power Supply - 12VDC, 600mA (Barrel Jack)</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$9.25/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons High voltage Expensive Enough current Only needed for the motor Uses a barrel jack Not a well known supplier </li> <li> <p>Switching Split Power Supply \u00b1 12V 500mA Split Supply</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$14.95/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Multiple jacks If used with other things would need a seperate voltage regulator Not too much current Might not need the white power supply line Up to 12 V Short cord length </li> <li> <p>12V 5A switching power supply</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$24.95/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Up to 12 V High current You can use any plug adapter Expensive There's a green indicator light to let you know it's working Bulky in the middle of wires </li> </ol> <p>Choice: Option 3: 12V 5A switching power supply</p> <p>Rationale: Though the supplier is not as well known and the data sheet is harder to understand, this had enough current without going overboard since this will power the whole system and not just this subsystem.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This is the Bill of Materials section of the Motor subsystem.
