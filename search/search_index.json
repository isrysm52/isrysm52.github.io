This has a light which will tell the user when the motor is on and when it is moving. This system also uses open connections to let other systems interact with systems they do not connect to. The power needed in this system is 12V for the motor and 5V for the microchip. The H-bridge used is one specifically designed to handle 12V when powering the motor. </p> <ul> <li>Connections</li> </ul> <p>The motor connects to each of the three other sub sytems. This is because when a sub system is activated it will tell the motor to either move, stop, slow down, or wait. The motor is needed to communicate each part of this to move the door and make our product successfull. </p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#example-block-diagram","title":"Example Block Diagram","text":"<p>Showing an example of how to import a screenshot of the block diagram created outside of git and brought into a page.</p> <p></p> <p>The Draw.io here is a link to the origional draw.io used to make the diagram. </p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection Example","text":"<p>Motor and Gearbox</p> <ol> <li> <p>Uxcell JCF63R DC 24V 80W 160RPM High Torque Reversible Electric Gear Motor 160RPM</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$59.49/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Powerful Expensive Fully enclosed Non-ventilated Any angle orientation No thermal protection </li> <li> <p>Dc Gearmotor, 16 in-lb Max.

We also need something within budget and will still work even if the door is slow to open. This motor though small, may be able to use the dimenstions to make the product more userfriendly and compact. </p> <p>H-Bridge</p> <ol> <li> <p>L9110H H-Bridge Motor Driver for DC Motors - 8 DIP - 2.5V-12V 800mA</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$1.50/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Can handle 12V 8 pronged only so only one motor Inexpensive 800 mA current limit Comes with kickback diodes No split logic/power pins </li> <li> <p>Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver for DC or Steppers - 600mA - L293D</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$8.95/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Up to 36 V More expensive 16 pins 600mA current Limit The motor voltage is separate from the logic voltage.

Option 3 is good, but we do not need that many pins and it would complicate the PCB baord and overcrowd the board. </p> <p>Potentiometer</p> <ol> <li> <p>Panel Mount 100K potentiometer (Breadboard Friendly) - 100KB</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$0.95/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Bigger Resistance Havent used before Grippy Shaft Thin prongs Can cause bigger speed changes Only 300 degrees of rotation </li> <li> <p>Panel Mount 10K Log Potentiometer (Breadboard Friendly) - 10K Log</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$0.95/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Grippy Shaft Less resistance High torque Thin Prongs Inexpensive Small handle </li> <li> <p>PTA3043-2010CIB104</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$1.65/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons High resistance Big Size Inexpensive More space taken up on the PCB Slide instead of rotate Not used to this type of potentiometer </li> </ol> <p>Choice: Option 3: PTA3043-2010CIB104</p> <p>Rationale: The slide potentiometer is a lot more user friendly than useal breadboard potentiometers. THis will also help where we can label different resistances to different speeds. Using only a small potentiometer was an option, but the changes in the motor speed would then need to be amplified in an op amp or similar to get results we could get with a higher resistance potentiometer. This also gives a wider range of speeds than a 10k potentiometer. </p> <p>Unregulated Power Supply</p> <ol> <li> <p>Wall Adapter Power Supply - 12VDC, 600mA (Barrel Jack)</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$9.25/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons High voltage Expensive Enough current Only needed for the motor Uses a barrel jack Not a well known supplier </li> <li> <p>Switching Split Power Supply \u00b1 12V 500mA Split Supply</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$14.95/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Multiple jacks If used with other things would need a seperate voltage regulator Not too much current Might not need the white power supply line Up to 12 V Short cord length </li> <li> <p>12V 5A switching power supply</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$24.95/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Up to 12 V High current You can use any plug adapter Expensive There's a green indicator light to let you know it's working Bulky in the middle of wires </li> </ol> <p>Choice: Option 1: Wall Adapter Power Supply - 12VDC, 600mA (Barrel Jack)</p> <p>Rationale: Though the supplier is not as well known and the data sheet is harder to understand, this had enough current without going overboard. THis is also a lot less bulky and will only be used with the motor. </p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>written context</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#bill-of-materials-example-as-table","title":"Bill of Materials Example (as Table)","text":"<p>Table ##: An example of one approach to adding your BOM table to this section.</p> Part Name/Description Qty Unit Cost Total Cost Manufacture Manufacturer # Vendor Link Datasheet Link Schematic Reference Designators 8-bit SIPO/SISO Shift Register, SOIC-16 package 1 $0.49 $ 0.49 NXP 74HC595D,112 DigiKey datasheet link U1 0.1 \u00b5F Ceramic Capacitor, +/-10%, X7R, 50V, 0805 package 10 0.2750 $2.75 KEMET C0805F104K5RACTU PRLTA 109 n/a C2, C4, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C16 <p>Note: Setting it up as a table is nice because it is completely viewable without scaling issues.
