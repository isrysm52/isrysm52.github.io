# Overview

This is the PCB of the updated schematic for the motor system. This shows how the conections are placed when traced under a PCB in a 100x100 mm size constrant. The first picture is the working model on a breadboard.

The DRC had no errors and only 9 warnings which were about letters being snipped off durning the creation of the PCB. You can view a PDF [*here*](isrysm52.github.io/docs/04-Schematic/Motor_System_PCB_DRC.pdf). And the Gerber Files [*here*](isrysm52.github.io/docs/04-Schematic/Gerber_Motor_System_IRS.zip).
