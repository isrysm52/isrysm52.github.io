## Introduction

* This data sheet focuses on the design and program of the motor in the private use automatic door opener. 

### Project Summary

* This is the motor design of an automatic door opener. This subsystem is one of four systems in a team project designed to make an automatic door open with sensors instead of buttons or handles. This is for safety and convienience for households that have too many things to juggle going in and out of doors. The motor design itself is built to take commands from two IR sensors, a flex sensor, and a rotary encoder. The [team report.](https://egr304-2025-f-103.github.io/) will show how each subsystem works together as well as the links to the other three subsystems that will be sharing information for this program. 


### My Contribution

* As team lead, I planned the team meetings and lead the team in how to design and program the automatic door. I also programmed the motor and the steps the motor needed to start, stop, and wait while it recieves information from other components. 

* Areas of Interest: 

To review the details used to display the connections of the motor with other subsystems, you can review it in the ["Block Diagram"](isrysm52.github.io/docs/01-Block-Diagram) section of the datasheet.


To review the details of different components we used to choose each component, you can review it in the ["Component Selection"](isrysm52.github.io/docs/02-Component-Selection) section of the datasheet.


To review the details listed of the material used to construct the subsection, you can review it in the ["BOM"](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304DataSheetTemplate/03-BOM/BOM/) section of the datasheet.


To review the details concerning the motion of power and how each cojmponent get energy, you can review it in the ["Power Budget"](isrysm52.github.io/docs/05-Power-Budget) section of the datasheet.


To review additional details not explicetly listed, you can review it in the ["Appendix"](isrysm52.github.io/docs/Appendix) section of the datasheet.
