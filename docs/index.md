## Introduction

* This data sheet focuses on the design and program of the motor in the private use automatic door opener. 

### Project Summary

* This needs to be updated to reflect <ins>your version</ins> of the team project, so when shared not via the team's report, the reader gets an idea of the direction of the project and how your work will contribute to the overall success.
* Add context that ties into the link to your [team report.](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304TeamTemplate/)


### My Contribution

* As team lead, I planned the team meetings and lead the team in how to design and program the automatic door. I also programmed the motor and the steps the motor needed to start, stop, and wait while it recieves information from other components. 

* Areas of Interest: 

To review the details used to display the connections of the motor with other subsystems, you can review it in the ["Block Diagram"](isrysm52.github.io/docs/01-Block-Diagram) section of the datasheet.


To review the details of different components we used to choose each component, you can review it in the ["Component Selection"](isrysm52.github.io/docs/02-Component-Selection) section of the datasheet.


To review the details listed of the material used to construct the subsection, you can review it in the ["BOM"](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304DataSheetTemplate/03-BOM/BOM/) section of the datasheet.


To review the details concerning the motion of power and how each cojmponent get energy, you can review it in the ["Power Budget"](isrysm52.github.io/docs/05-Power-Budget) section of the datasheet.


To review additional details not explicetly listed, you can review it in the ["Appendix"](isrysm52.github.io/docs/Appendix) section of the datasheet.
